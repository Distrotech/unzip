To contact the authors with suggestions, bug reports,\r\nor fixes, continue reading this file (README) and, if this is part of a\r\nsource distribution, the file \"ZipPorts\" in the proginfo directory.  Also\r\nin source distributions:  read \"BUGS\" for a list of known bugs, non-bugs\r\nand possible future bugs; INSTALL for instructions on how to build UnZip;\r\nand \"Contents\" for a commented listing of all the distributed files.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFO\r\n------------\r\nUnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip format (also\r\ncalled \"zipfiles\").  Although highly compatible both with PKWARE's PKZIP\r\nand PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's own Zip program, our\r\nprimary objectives have been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.\r\n\r\nThis version of UnZip has been ported to a stupendous array of hardware--\r\nfrom micros to supercomputers--and operating systems:  Unix (many flavors),\r\nVMS, OS/2 (including DLL version), Windows NT and Windows 95 (including DLL\r\nversion), Windows CE (GUI version), Windows 3.x (including DLL version),\r\nMS-DOS, AmigaDOS, Atari TOS, Acorn RISC OS, BeOS, Macintosh (GUI version),\r\nSMS/QDOS, MVS, VM/CMS, FlexOS, Tandem NSK, Human68k (mostly), AOS/VS (partly)\r\nand TOPS-20 (partly).  UnZip features not found in PKUNZIP include source\r\ncode; default extraction of directory trees (with a switch to defeat this,\r\nrather than the reverse); system-specific extended file attributes; and, of\r\ncourse, the ability to run under most of your favorite operating systems.\r\nPlus, it's free. :-)\r\n\r\nFor source distributions, see the main Contents file for a list of what's\r\nincluded, and read INSTALL for instructions on compiling (including OS-\r\nspecific comments).  The individual operating systems' Contents files (for\r\nexample, vms/Contents) may list important compilation info in addition to\r\nexplaining what files are what, so be sure to read them.  Some of the ports\r\nhave their own, special README files, so be sure to look for those, too.\r\n\r\nSee unzip.1 or unzip.txt for usage (or the corresponding UnZipSFX, ZipInfo,\r\nfUnZip and ZipGrep docs).  For VMS, unzip_def.rnh or unzip_cli.help may be\r\ncompiled into unzip.hlp and installed as a normal VMS help entry; see\r\nvms/descrip.mms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES AND NEW FEATURES\r\n------------------------\r\nUnZip 6.0 finally supports nowadays \"large\" files of sizes > 2 GiB!\r\nThis is the first release containing support for the PKWARE Zip64\r\nenhancements.\r\nMajor changes are:\r\n   - Support PKWARE ZIP64 extensions, allowing Zip archives and Zip archive\r\n     entries larger than 4 GiBytes and more than 65536 entries within a single\r\n     Zip archive. This support is currently only available for Unix,\r\n     OpenVMS and Win32/Win64.\r\n   - Support for bzip2 compression method.\r\n   - Support for UTF-8 encoded entry names, both through PKWARE's \"General\r\n     Purpose Flags Bit 11\" indicator and Info-ZIP's new \"up\" unicode path\r\n     extra field.  (Currently, on Windows the UTF-8 handling is limited to\r\n     the character subset contained in the configured non-unicode \"system\r\n     code page\".)\r\n   - Added \"wrong implementation used\" warning to error messages of the MSDOS\r\n     port when used under Win32, in an attempt to reduce false bug reports.\r\n   - Fixed \"Time of Creation/Time of Use\" vulnerability when setting attributes\r\n     of extracted files, for Unix and Unix-like ports.\r\n   - Fixed memory leak when processing invalid deflated data.\r\n   - Fixed long-standing bug in unshrink (partial_clear), added boundary checks\r\n     against invalid compressed data.\r\n   - On Unix, keep inherited SGID attribute bit for extracted directories\r\n     unless restoration of owner/group id or SUID/SGID/Tacky attributes was\r\n     requested.\r\n   - On Unix, allow extracted filenames to contain embedded control characters\r\n     when explicitly requested by specifying the new command line option \"-^\".\r\n   - On Unix, support restoration of symbolic link attributes.\r\n   - On Unix, support restoration of 32-bit UID/GID data using the new \"ux\"\r\n     IZUNIX3 extra field introduced with Zip 3.0.\r\n   - Support for ODS5 extended filename syntax on new OpenVMS systems.\r\n   - Support symbolic links zipped up on VMS.\r\n   - On VMS (only 8.x or better), support symbolic link creation.\r\n   - On VMS, support option to create converted text files in Stream_LF format.\r\n   - New -D option to suppress restoration of timestamps for extracted\r\n     directory entries (on those ports that support setting of directory\r\n     timestamps).  By specifying \"-DD\", this new option also allows to suppress\r\n     timestamp restoration for ALL extracted files on all UnZip ports which\r\n     support restoration of timestamps.\r\n     On VMS, the default behaviour is now to skip restoration of directory\r\n     timestamps; here, \"--D\" restores ALL timestamps, \"-D\" restores none.\r\n   - On OS/2, Win32, and Unix, the (previously optional) feature UNIXBACKUP\r\n     to allow saving backup copies of overwritten files on extraction is now\r\n     enabled by default.\r\n\r\nFor the UnZip 6.0 release, we want to give special credit to Myles Bennet,\r\nwho started the job of supporting ZIP64 extensions and Large-File (> 2GiB)\r\nand provided a first (alpha-state) port.\r\n\r\nThe 5.52 maintenance release fixes a few minor problems found in the 5.51\r\nrelease, closes some more security holes, adds a new AtheOS port, and\r\ncontains a Win32 extra-field code cleanup that was not finished earlier.\r\nThe most important changes are:\r\n\r\n   - (re)enabled unshrinking support by default, the LZW patents have expired\r\n   - fixed an extraction size bug for encrypted stored entries (12 excess bytes\r\n     were written with 5.51)\r\n   - fixed false \"uncompressed size mismatch\" messages when extracting\r\n     encrypted archive entries\r\n   - do not restore SUID/SGID/Tacky attribute bits on Unix (BeOS, AtheOS)\r\n     unless explicitely requested by new \"-K\" command line qualifier\r\n   - optional support for \"-W\" qualifier to modify the pattern matching syntax\r\n     (with -W: \"*\" stops at directory delimiter, \"**\" matches unlimited)\r\n   - prevent buffer overflow caused by bogus extra-long Zipfile specification\r\n   - performance enhancements for VMS port\r\n   - fixed windll interface handling of its extraction mode qualifiers\r\n     nfflag, ExtractOnlyNewer, noflag, PromptToOverwrite; added detailed\r\n     explanation of their meanings and interactions to the windll documentation\r\n\r\nThe 5.51 maintenance release adds a command-line CE port, intended for\r\nbatch processing. With the integration of this port, the pUnZip port\r\nhas been revised and \"revitalized\".\r\nThe most important changes for the general public are a number of\r\nbug fixes, mostly related to security issues:\r\n\r\n   - repair a serious bug in the textmode output conversion code for the 16-bit\r\n     ports (16-bit MSDOS, OS/2 1.x, some variants of AMIGA, possibly others)\r\n     which was introduced by the Deflate64 support of release 5.5\r\n   - fix a long standing bug in the the inflate decompression method that\r\n     prevented correct extraction in some rare cases\r\n   - fixed holes in parent dir traversal security code (e.g.: \".^C.\" slipped\r\n     through the previous version of the check code)\r\n   - fixed security hole: check naming consistency in local and central header\r\n   - fixed security hole: prevent extracted symlinks from redirecting file\r\n     extraction paths\r\n\r\nThe main addition in the 5.5 release is support for PKWARE's new Deflate64(tm)\r\nalgorithm, which appeared first in PKZIP 4.0 (published November 2000).\r\nAs usual, some other bugfixes and clean-ups have been integrated:\r\n\r\n   - support for Deflate64 (Zip compression method #9)\r\n   - support for extracting VMS variable length record text files on\r\n     any system\r\n   - optional \"cheap autorun\" feature for the SFX stub\r\n   - security fixes:\r\n     * strip leading slash from stored pathspecs,\r\n     * remove \"../\" parent dir path components from extracted file names\r\n   - new option \"-:\" to allow verbatim extraction of file names containing\r\n     \"../\" parent dir path specs\r\n   - fixed file handle leak for the DLL code\r\n   - repaired OS2 & WinNT ACL extraction which was broken in 5.42\r\n\r\nThe 5.42 maintenance release fixes more bugs and cleans up the redistribution\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\n   - removal of unreduce.c and amiga/timelib.c code to get rid of the last\r\n     distribution restrictions beyond the BSD-like Info-ZIP LICENSE\r\n   - new generic timelib replacement (currently used by AMIGA port)\r\n   - more reasonable mapping rules of UNIX \"leading-dot\" filenames to the\r\n     DOS 8.3 name convention\r\n   - repaired screensize detection in MORE paging code\r\n     (was broken for DOS/OS2/WIN32 in 5.41)\r\n\r\nThe 5.41 maintenance release adds another new port and fixes some bugs.\r\n\r\n   - new BSD-like LICENSE\r\n   - new Novell Netware NLM port\r\n   - supports extraction of archives with more than 64k entries\r\n   - attribute handling of VMS port was broken in UnZip 5.4\r\n   - decryption support integrated in the main source distribution\r\n\r\nThe 5.4 release adds new ports, again. Other important items are changes\r\nto the listing format, new supplemental features and several bug fixes\r\n(especially concerning time-stamp handling...):\r\n\r\n   - new IBM OS/390 port, a UNIX derivate (POSIX with EBCDIC charset)\r\n   - complete revision of the MacOS port\r\n   - changed listing formats to enlarge the file size fields for more digits\r\n   - added capability to restore directory attributes on MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32\r\n   - enabled support of symbolic links on BeOS\r\n   - Unix: optional Acorn filetype support, useful for volumes exported via NFS\r\n   - several changes/additions to the DLL API\r\n   - GUI SFX stub for Win16 (Windows 3.1) and Win32 (Windows 9x, Windows NT)\r\n   - new free GCC compiler environments supported on WIN32\r\n   - many time-zone handling bug fixes for WIN32, AMIGA, ...\r\n\r\nThe 5.32 release adds two new ports and a fix for at least one relatively\r\nserious bug:\r\n\r\n   - new FlexOS port\r\n   - new Tandem NSK port\r\n   - new Visual BASIC support (compatibility with the Windows DLLs)\r\n   - new -T option (set zipfile timestamp) for virtually all ports\r\n   - fix for timestamps beyond 2038 (e.g., 2097; crashed under DOS/Win95/NT)\r\n   - fix for undetected \"dangling\" symbolic links (i.e., no pointee)\r\n   - fix for VMS indexed-file extraction problem (stored with Zip 2.0 or 2.1)\r\n   - further performance optimizations\r\n\r\nThe 5.31 release included nothing but small bug-fixes and typo corrections,\r\nwith the exception of some minor performance tweaks.\r\n\r\nThe 5.3 release added still more ports and more cross-platform portability\r\nfeatures:\r\n\r\n   - new BeOS port\r\n   - new SMS/QDOS port\r\n   - new Windows CE graphical port\r\n   - VM/CMS port fully updated and tested\r\n   - MVS port fully updated and tested\r\n   - updated Windows DLL port, with WiZ GUI spun off to a separate package\r\n   - full Universal Time (UTC or GMT) support for trans-timezone consistency\r\n   - cross-platform support for 8-bit characters (ISO Latin-1, OEM code pages)\r\n   - support for NT security descriptors (ACLs)\r\n   - support for overwriting OS/2 directory EAs if -o option given\r\n   - updated Solaris/SVR4 package facility\r\n\r\nWhat is (still!) not added is multi-part archive support (a.k.a. \"diskette\r\nspanning\", though we really mean archive splitting and not the old diskette\r\nspanning) and a unified and more powerful DLL interface.  These are the two\r\nhighest priorities for the 6.x releases.  Work on the former is almost\r\ncertain to have commenced by the time you read this.  This time we mean it!\r\nYou betcha. :-)\r\n\r\nAlthough the DLLs are still basically a mess, the Windows DLLs (16- and 32-\r\nbit) now have some documentation and a small example application.  Note that\r\nthey should now be compatible with C/C++, Visual BASIC and Delphi.  Weirder\r\nlanguages (FoxBase, etc.) are probably Right Out.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNET RESOURCES\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nInfo-ZIP's web site is at http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/\r\nand contains the most up-to-date information about coming releases,\r\nlinks to binaries, and common problems.\r\n(See http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/FAQ.html for the latter.)\r\nFiles may also be retrieved via ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/ .\r\nThanks to LEO (Munich, Germany) for previously hosting our primary site.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n------------\r\nIf you have a question regarding redistribution of Info-ZIP software, either\r\nas is, as packaging for a commercial product, or as an integral part of a\r\ncommercial product, please read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section\r\nof the included COPYING file.  All Info-ZIP releases are now covered by\r\nthe Info-ZIP license.  See the file LICENSE.  The most current license\r\nshould be available at http://www.info-zip.org/license.html and\r\nftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/license.html.\r\n\r\nInsofar as C compilers are rare on some platforms and the authors only have\r\ndirect access to a subset of the supported systems, others may wish to pro-\r\nvide ready-to-run executables for new systems.  In general there is no prob-\r\nlem with this; we require only that such distributions include this README\r\nfile, the WHERE file, the LICENSE file (contains copyright/redistribution\r\ninformation), and the appropriate documentation files (unzip.txt and/or\r\nunzip.1 for UnZip, etc.).  If the local system provides a way to make self-\r\nextracting archives in which both the executables and text files can be\r\nstored together, that's best (in particular, use UnZipSFX if at all possible,\r\neven if it's a few kilobytes bigger than the alternatives); otherwise we\r\nsuggest a bare UnZip executable and a separate zipfile containing the re-\r\nmaining text and binary files.  If another archiving method is in common\r\nuse on the target system (for example, Zoo or LHa), that may also be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUGS AND NEW PORTS:  CONTACTING INFO-ZIP\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nAll bug reports and patches (context diffs only, please!) should be\r\nsubmitted either through the new Info-ZIP Discussion Forum at\r\nhttp://www.info-zip.org/board/board.pl or through the Info-ZIP SourceForge\r\nsite at http://sourceforge.net/projects/infozip/.  The forum allows file\r\nattachments while SourceForge provides a place to post patches.  The old\r\nZip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu e-mail address for the Info-ZIP authors was\r\ndiscontinued after heavy continuous spam, as was the QuickTopic discussion\r\nforum.  The above methods are public, but we also can be reached directly\r\nusing the web reply page at http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html.  If you\r\nneed to send us files privately, contact us first for instructions.\r\n\r\n\"Dumb questions\" that aren't adequately answered in the documentation\r\nshould also be directed to Zip-Bugs rather than to a global forum such\r\nas Usenet.  (Kindly make certain that your question *isn't* answered by\r\nthe documentation, however--a great deal of effort has gone into making\r\nit clear and complete.)\r\n\r\nSuggestions for new features can be discussed on the new Discussion Forum.\r\nA new mailing list for Info-ZIP beta testers and interested parties may\r\nbe created someday, but for now any issues found in the betas should use\r\nthe forum.  We make no promises to act on all suggestions or even all\r\npatches, but if it is something that is manifestly useful, sending the\r\nrequired patches to Zip-Bugs directly (as per the instructions in the\r\nZipPorts file) is likely to produce a quicker response than asking us to\r\ndo it--the authors are always ridiculously short on time.  (Please do\r\nNOT send patches or encoded zipfiles to the Info-ZIP list.  Please DO\r\nread the ZipPorts file before sending any large patch.  It would be\r\ndifficult to over-emphasize this point...)\r\n\r\nIf you are considering a port, not only should you read the ZipPorts file,\r\nbut also please check in with Zip-Bugs BEFORE getting started, since the\r\ncode is constantly being updated behind the scenes.  (For example, VxWorks,\r\nVMOS and Netware ports were once claimed to be under construction, although\r\nwe have yet to see any up-to-date patches.)  We will arrange to send you the\r\nlatest sources.  The alternative is the possibility that your hard work will\r\nbe tucked away in a subdirectory and mostly ignored, or completely ignored\r\nif someone else has already done the port (and you'd be surprised how often\r\nthis has happened).\r\n\r\n\r\nBETA TESTING:  JOINING INFO-ZIP\r\n-------------------------------\r\nIf you'd like to keep up to date with our UnZip (and companion Zip utility)\r\ndevelopment, join the ranks of beta testers, add your own thoughts and\r\ncontributions, or simply lurk, you may join one of our mailing lists.\r\nThere is an announcements-only list (Info-ZIP-announce) and a general\r\ndiscussion/testing list (Info-ZIP). You must be a subscriber to post, and\r\nyou can subscribe via the links on our Frequently Asked Questions page:\r\n\r\n        http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/FAQ.html#lists\r\n\r\n(Please note that as of late May 2004, the lists are unavailable pending\r\na move to a new site; we hope to have them restored shortly.  In the\r\ninterim ...)  Feel free to use our bug-reporting web page for bug reports\r\nand to ask questions not answered on the FAQ page above:\r\n\r\n        http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html\r\n\r\nFor now the best option is to monitor and contribute to the various threads\r\non the new discussion forum site at:\r\n\r\n      http://www.info-zip.org/board/board.pl\r\n\r\nThe second best way to contribute is through the various features at\r\nSourceForge, such as the bug posting areas.\r\n\r\nThere is also a closed mailing list for internal discussions of our core\r\ndevelopment team. This list is now kept secret to prevent us from being\r\nflooded with spam messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- Greg Roelofs (sometimes known as Cave Newt), principal UnZip developer\r\n   guy, with inspiration from David Kirschbaum, was Author of this text.\r\n\r\n-- Christian Spieler (shorthand: SPC), current UnZip maintenance coordinator,\r\n   applied the most recent changes, with Ed Gordon providing a few additions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
